# Trivia game
### In this game you get to pick one of 4 different themes and test your knowledge on Cars, TV shows, History or Games. 

Once you're in the main menu, just click start game. After a little magic hat dance, you'll be given a choice and after you pick one of 4 games,
countdown automatically starts. Have fun!

_note:_ In this game I used the Circulate JQuery plugin from CSS Tricks website (https://css-tricks.com/circulate/) for the 
hat animation(random circles) in the beginnning of the game when user clicks the "Start game" button
